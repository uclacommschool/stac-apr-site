# Overview of Engaging Educational Partners in Year 3

Analysis of Year 3 APR data indicates that schools were most successful in engaging administrators (89.7% at 75-100% engagement rate), certified staff (58.2% at 75-100% engagement rate), and classified staff (44.2% at 75-100% engagement rate). More than 60% of respondents also reported engaging 75-100% of community partners. Despite 6% of grantees indicate a 0% engagement rate of students, longitudinal trends of Y1 through Y3 showed that students engaged at 0% have decreased in Year 3 from previous two years (see below).

For **Internal Use** only, some of these groups are **very high in NA’s**, which means many respondents did not fill it out. This is something our recent revisions (e.g., removing Community Members as a reporting category) can help address in the upcoming year.

## Historically Marginalized Groups {style="text-align: center;"}

In Year 3, more than half of grantees reported engaging 75-100% of foster youth and racially marginalized students. However, foster youth and students experiencing homelessness are two groups with the highest percentage of grantees reporting 0% engagement.
