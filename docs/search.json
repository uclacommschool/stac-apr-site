Grantees were asked to submit three goals associated with their CCSPP implementation and in line with the California Community Schools Framework and the Whole Child and Family Supports Inventory. There were a total of (5,254 goals) submitted in total across 1,920 grantees.\nThe top categories across all goals submitted were:\n\nSocial-Emotional Well-Being & Mental Health: “Provide consistent access to school-based mental health support through structured referral and service delivery systems.” / “Positive and Restorative School Climate Increase Student Social Emotional Learning (SEL) Wellness”\nAttendance & Absenteeism Reduction: “Reduce chronic absenteeism through early detection systems, and monthly attendance-focused family workshops.”\nFamily & Community Engagement: “There will be a monthly engagement of each group (students, staff, families and community partners) that centers community school work.”\nAcademic Achievement & Student Learning: “Increase student academic achievement by strengthening tutoring and specialist intervention systems.”\nSchool Climate & Shared Leadership: “Implement a positive and restorative school climate”\nCommunity School Framework & Whole-School Implementation: “To create community Schools Team that center the voices of students, families and community;”\nIntegrated Student Supports: “Fill gaps in integrated support services for students”\n\nGrantees were also asked to submit a metric associated with each school-specific goal. The most common metric selected was “Other locally developed metric”, which was selected for about a third of all goals submitted. Other common metrics included chronic absenteeism rates, climate measures and proficiency scores. Within the category of “other” local measures, some common metrics were: [add analysis here]."

    "text": "Overview of Capacity Building Strategies in Year 3\nOverall, Year 3 APR data indicates that Strategic Community Partnership has 14%, the highest percentage of grantees with a self rating of being in the “Transforming” phase, compared to other Capacity Building Strategies. For three Capacity Building Strategies- Sustaining Staff and Resources, Strategic Community Partnerships, and Collaborative Leadership, there are more schools identifying as Engaging than Visioning. For Shared Commitment, Understanding, and Priorities, and Centering Community-Based Learning, there are more grantees in the Visioning phase than the Engaging phase.\n\n\n\nCapacity Building Strategies: Year 1-3 Trends\nA closer look at Cohort 1 schools (Cohort 1 in Year 1 = 450 Schools; Cohort 1 in Year 2 = 431 Schools; Cohort 1 in Year 3 = 435 Schools) across the three years of implementation reveal several trends. There is an overall trend of grantees moving from Visioning to Engaging, and from Engaging to Transforming over the three years. Cohort 1 grantees have achieved great successes in several capacity building strategies. Nearly one in three Cohort 1 grantees (32.4%) self-reported as being in the “Transforming” phase in Strategic Community Leadership. The percentage of grantees in “Visioning” have decreased significantly. For instance, while 62% of grantees considered themselves still in “Visioning phase in Year 1, this percentage lowered to only 27.4% in Year 3 for Centering Community-Based Learning.\n\nShared Commitment, Understanding and PrioritiesCentering Community-Based LearningCollaborative LeadershipStrategic Community PartnershipsSustaining Staff and Resources"

More than 60% of respondents also reported engaging 75-100% of community partners. Despite 6% of grantees indicate a 0% engagement rate of students, longitudinal trends of Y1 through Y3 showed that students engaged at 0% has dropped to the lowest in Year 3 from previous two years (see below).\n\nFor Internal Use only, some of these groups are very high in NA’s, which means many respondents did not fill it out. This is something our recent revisions (e.g., removed Community Members as a reporting category; added the definition of Community Partners) can help address in the upcoming year.\n\n\n\nStakeholder Group\n0%\n1-24%\n25-49%\n50-74%\n75-100%\nNA\n\n\n\n\nAdministrators\n2\n6\n53\n130\n1664\n64\n\n\nCertified Staff\n22\n325\n189\n221\n1052\n110\n\n\nClassified Staff\n39\n457\n241\n270\n797\n115\n\n\nCommunity Members\n386\n560\n17\n4\n9\n943\n\n\nCommunity Partners\n52\n95\n157\n177\n827\n661\n\n\nFamily Members\n45\n761\n333\n210\n364\n206\n\n\nStudents\n104\n431\n237\n243\n719\n185\n\n\n\n\n\nEngaging Educational Partners: Y1-Y3 Trends\nIn Cohort 1 schools, we see steady increases in the percentage of grantees that reported engaging each group of stakeholders at 75-100% each year. Year 3 APR shows particularly enhanced engagement of community partners, which increased by 40 percentage points.\n\nThe following two graphs break the results down by groups of stakeholders, and showcase longitudinal trends of engaging students and community partners. Compared to previous years, the percentage of Cohort 1 grantees that reported engaging students and community partners at 0% dropped to the lowest in Year 3. Compared to Year 2, fewer Cohort 1 grantees in Year 3 reported engaging students at 25-74%. For student engagement, grantees moved from these middle categories to a lower (1-24%) or a higher engagement level (75-100%). For community partners engagement, the majority of Cohort 1 grantees moved up to the highest (75%) engagement level.\n\nStudentsCommunity Partners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically Marginalized Groups\nIn Year 3, more than half of grantees reported engaging 75-100% of foster youth and racially marginalized students. However, foster youth and students experiencing homelessness are two groups where the highest percentage of grantees reported 0% engagement."
