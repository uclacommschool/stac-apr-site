# Capacity Building Strategies: Year 1-3 Trends

A closer look at Cohort 1 schools (Cohort 1 in Year 1 = 450 Schools; Cohort 1 in Year 2 = 431 Schools; Cohort 1 in Year 3 = 435 Schools) across the three years of implementation reveal several trends. There is an overall trend of grantees moving from Visioning to Engaging, and from Engaging to Transforming over the three years. Cohort 1 grantees have achieved great successes in several capacity building strategies. Nearly one in three Cohort 1 grantees (32.4%) self-reported as being in the “Transforming” phase in Strategic Community Leadership. The percentage of grantees in “Visioning” have decreased significantly. For instance, while 62% of grantees considered themselves still in “Visioning phase in Year 1, this percentage lowered to only 27.4% in Year 3 for Centering Community-Based Learning.
