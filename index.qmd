## California Community Schools Partnership Program (CCSPP)

**Annual Progress Report (APR)**

These visualizations reflect the data from the CCSPP APR for school sites for the **2022-2023 school year, the 2023-2024 school year and initial findings from the 2024-2025 school for the Capacity Building Strategies.**

**The APR serves as a tool to assess implementation efforts, and to encourage reflection as part of an ongoing continuous improvement process.** It was designed to be developed by each school's CCSPP shared decision-making team or council to ensure participation from students, staff, families and community partners. The report is intended to align with required annual update presentations on community school planning, including data and outcomes from the prior year at each school site.

The APR is aligned with the California Community Schools Framework and also aligns with resources provided by the State Transformational Assistance Center (S-TAC) including the Community Schools Implementation Plan Template, the Community Schools Needs and Assets Assessment (NAA) Guide, and the Capacity Building Strategies: A Developmental Rubric, that are available for optional use by grantees.
